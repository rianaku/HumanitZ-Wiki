## <span style="color:#E79543;">1. Game Setup</span>

<div style="background:#111; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">

**Recommended for new players:**

- Turn **permadeath OFF** for your first runs.
- Turn **loot respawn ON** so early mistakes don’t brick the save.
- Choose a profession that supports your intended playstyle  
  (e.g. mechanic if you want heavy vehicle use).

</div>

Use this section to later document exact difficulty sliders and what they change.

### 🧭 Priorities

1. **Scan surroundings** – identify immediate threats and buildings.  
2. **Grab any clothing, backpack, and basic melee weapon**.  
3. **Loot food and water** – you’ll burn through both fast.  
4. **Mark potential base candidates** – houses with:
   - Multiple exits  
   - Nearby loot sources  
   - Space for storage and crafting

## <span style="color:#E79543;">3. Establishing a Starter Base</span>

<details>
<summary><strong style="color:#E79543;">🏠 Starter Base Checklist</strong></summary>

- At least one building with:
  - Doors you can close and barricade  
  - A room that can be turned into a safe sleeping/storage area  
- Nearby:
  - Water source or reliable loot route  
  - Space to place crafting stations  
  - Room for vehicles later (garage/driveway if possible)  

</details>

<div style="background:#0F0F0F; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">
<strong>Tip:</strong> Don’t overbuild early. A modest, well-placed safe house beats an overextended fortress with no supplies.
</div>

## <span style="color:#E79543;">4. Early Gear Targets</span>

### 🔧 Minimum Kit to Aim For

- Melee weapon with decent stamina efficiency.
- Basic firearm + small stash of ammo.
- Backpack upgrade (capacity matters more than looks).
- Simple med supplies (bandages, painkillers, infection treatment once possible).
- Basic armor or tougher clothing if available.

Create sub-sections later with actual item names, stats, and locations.

## <span style="color:#E79543;">5. Basic Controls & Interaction</span>

Use this area for concrete control mappings and quick references.  
(e.g. movement, inventory, interaction, stealth, aiming, etc.)

<details>
<summary><strong style="color:#E79543;">⌨️ Example Controls (placeholder)</strong></summary>

- Movement: WASD  
- Interact: `E`  
- Inventory: `I`  
- Crouch: `C`

## <span style="color:#E79543;">6. First Night Strategy</span>

<div style="background:#111; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">

Night magnifies every mistake. Before nightfall:

- Be inside a defensible building.  
- Have **some** light source.  
- Have a modest stash of food, water, and a backup weapon.  
- Know at least one safe escape route if the base is overrun.

</div>

## <span style="color:#E79543;">7. Next Steps</span>

Once you survive your first day or two:

- Start planning a more permanent base (see **[Base Building](Base-Building.md)**).
- Learn the crafting stations and recipes (see **[Loot & Crafting](Loot-Crafting.md)**).
- Learn how hunger, thirst, infection, and injuries actually work  
  (**[Survival Mechanics](Survival-Mechanics.md)**).
- If playing co-op, align on roles (**[Multiplayer & Co-op](Multiplayer-&-Co-op.md)**).
