### 🪓 Melee Weapons

| Type | Role | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| Light (knives, small blades) | Fast, low stamina cost | Good vs single targets. |
| Medium (machetes, bats, axes) | Balance of speed/damage | Standard choice. |
| Heavy (sledgehammers, big axes) | High damage, high stamina cost | Better for strong enemies/structures. |

### 🔫 Firearms

| Class | Typical Use | Notes |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Pistols | Backup, close quarters | Lower noise than rifles (depending on game). |
| Shotguns | Close-range deletion | Limited effective range. |
| SMGs | High fire rate, mid damage | Ammo hungry. |
| Rifles | Medium-long range | Strong single-target damage. |
| Snipers / Special | Long-range precision | Rare ammo, niche use. |
