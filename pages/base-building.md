## <span style="color:#E79543;">1. Choosing a Location</span>

<div style="background:#111; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">

When picking a base spot, consider:

- **Access** – near good loot routes but not in the middle of them.
- **Defensibility** – choke points, fences, limited entry paths.
- **Escape routes** – you need backup exits.
- **Vehicle space** – future-proof for garages and parking.
- **Farming potential** – open ground or nearby plots.

## <span style="color:#E79543;">2. Base Types</span>

<details>
<summary><strong style="color:#E79543;">🏚️ Safe House</strong></summary>

- Minimal modifications to an existing building.
- Focus on:
  - Door/ window reinforcement.
  - Basic storage.
  - Sleeping area.
- Good for early game or nomadic play.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong style="color:#E79543;">🏰 Fortified Base</strong></summary>

- Multiple layers of defense.
- Dedicated crafting, storage, farming and vehicle zones.
- Used for long-term survival worlds or co-op groups.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong style="color:#E79543;">🧭 Outposts / Forward Camps</strong></summary>

- Small, lightly stocked shelters near distant POIs.
- Allow multi-day operations far from the main base.

## <span style="color:#E79543;">3. Materials & Upgrade Paths</span>

Describe here:

- Early materials: wood, scrap metal, basic tools.
- Mid-game: reinforced walls, better doors, metal structures.
- Late-game: heavy fortifications, traps, advanced stations.

You can later add tables like:

| Tier | Material | Use | Notes |
|------|----------|-----|-------|
| 1 | Wood | Basic walls, doors | Fast, weak |
| 2 | Metal | Reinforced structures | Slower, stronger |
| 3 | Concrete/Advanced | High-end defense | Very resource intensive |

## <span style="color:#E79543;">4. Core Base Modules</span>

### 📦 Storage

- Keep high-value and crafting resources sorted (metal, chemicals, ammo, etc.).
- Use labeled containers if possible (or clear naming conventions in co-op).

### 🔧 Crafting Zone

- Cluster workbench, chemistry, cooking, ammo benches for efficiency.
- Keep this area indoors or sheltered to reduce attack risk.

### 🌾 Farming / Food Production

- Farms close to your base to reduce travel time.
- Consider fencing or other protection from zeeks (if they interact with crops).

### 🚗 Vehicle Area

- Garage or parking area.
- Space to maneuver, repair, and store spare parts/fuel.

## <span style="color:#E79543;">5. Defensive Design</span>

<div style="background:#0F0F0F; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">

Basic defensive concepts:

- **Funnels:** force enemies through narrow entries.  
- **Kill zones:** overlapping fields of fire.  
- **Fallback layers:** inner doors/walls to retreat behind.  
- **Noise management:** know which activities draw attention.

</div>

Add specifics as the building system is tested more (what zeeks can/can’t break, etc.).
