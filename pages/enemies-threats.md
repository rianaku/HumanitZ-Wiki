- **Runners** – fast, fragile, dangerous in groups.  
- **Armored / Tough** – slower, high HP.  
- **Specials** – unique abilities (spits, grabs, etc. – confirm per game version).

## <span style="color:#E79543;">4. Combat Behaviour & Escalation</span>

<div style="background:#0F0F0F; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">

Questions to answer as the wiki grows:

- How do zeeks detect you? (sight, sound, both?)
- How long do they chase?
- Do they respawn around noise, bodies, or over time?
- Can they damage player-built structures, and how quickly?

Use this section for tested behaviour and patch-specific notes.

## <span style="color:#E79543;">5. Threat Rating by Area</span>

You can build a table like:

| Area Type | Threat Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Rural outskirts | Low | Fewer zeeks, less loot. |
| Small towns | Medium | Mixed loot and risk. |
| City centers | High | Dense zeeks, best gear. |
| Special POIs | Very High | Boss-level difficulty, unique loot. |
