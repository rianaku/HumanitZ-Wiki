## <span style="color:#E79543;">5. Loot Progression & Risk</span>

<div style="background:#0F0F0F; padding:16px; border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px;">

Loot quality tends to scale with:

- Proximity to urban centers / POIs.
- Risk level (more zeeks, smaller escape windows).
- Map knowledge and route planning.

Common pattern:  
**Safer outskirts → basic supplies**  
**Dangerous POIs → higher-end weapons, armor, and components**
